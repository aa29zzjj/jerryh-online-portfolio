Note: I have revise some part in Part I to make the direction straight.
# Wireframes/storyboards
Following the sketches and outline from Part I, I began constructing the actual narrative within Shorthand. The current draft incorporates interactive visualizations and data-driven storytelling based on the factors influencing Pennsylvania’s shrinking population.

# User research 

## Target audience
Residents of Pennsylvania (especially students and young professionals), state policymakers, and individuals interested in regional planning or demographic trends.

## Interview script

The purpose of my interview script is to determine whether audiences can understand the core issue behind Pennsylvania's shrinking population.

| Goal                                                                  | Questions to Ask                                       |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
|To understand what does audience feels when looking at the visuals     |How do you feel when you see these data visuals?        |
|To see if there is any improvement for the story                       |What do you think to make the story better?             |
|To check if the audience gets the thing I want to present              |What is the first information you get from the visuals? |



## Interview findings

| Questions                                        | Student 1                                                                                        | Student 2                          |
|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| How do you feel when you review my data visuals? | For the education rate, I would say it is better to include the people who graduated from high school.| The topic of the graph should be clear |
| Do you get the thing I want to present?          | Yes, but I would say the  line chart can be more clear.                                |Maybe you can compare the counties with increasing populations to see if there is a big difference?             |
|If there is anything I can improve for the story. Please tell me                         | Can just focus on one crucial part                               | some graphs are not suitable for the story            |

### Things that can be improved:
1. The name of the graphic can be more simple and understandable to viewers
2. The line chart looks kind of difficult to review, can be clearer so viewers will not misunderstand the graph
3.  The education rate can be broader, people who graduated from high school are also counted as fully educated.
4.  Unnecessary graphs, and things not related to the story should be removed
5.  Can put the Top 5 increasing Pennsylvania counties to see the difference between the Top 5 shrinking counties.

# Identified changes for Part III

These are the things I would like to build for Part III:

| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| The education rate visual may be misleading—it doesn’t include high school graduates. | Broaden the education rate definition to include high school graduates and adjust the visualization. |
| Some viewers found the line chart unclear or difficult to follow.    | Improve readability of the line chart by adding clear titles, labels, and perhaps switching to bar charts where helpful.    |
| The graph titles are too technical or long.  | Simplify and clarify all graph titles to be more viewer-friendly and aligned with the story. |
| Some charts were considered unnecessary or not aligned with the story.  | Review all visualizations and remove those not directly supporting the main narrative.    |
| Compare only shrinking counties might lack context. | 	Add a comparison to Top 5 increasing counties to provide more meaningful contrast in the story.     |
|Overall narrative felt broad—too many focuses. |	Refine story to focus on one or two key aspects, such as the relationship between salary and shrinkage.|


### Final Thoughts:
I learned that clarity and relevance are key in visual storytelling. In Part III, I plan to streamline the narrative, focus on the shrinking counties vs. growing counties comparison, and ensure that all visual elements directly support the message. I also plan to revise chart types and titles to enhance viewer understanding.
