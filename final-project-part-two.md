# Wireframes / storyboards
Following the sketches and outline from Part I, I began constructing the actual narrative within Shorthand. The current draft incorporates interactive visualizations and data-driven storytelling based on the factors influencing Pennsylvaniaâ€™s shrinking population.

## Draft Visual Elements Included:
Bar chart showing population trends in the top 5 shrinking towns (Tableau).

Line graph depicting average annual salary per town.

Horizontal bar chart of unemployment rates across towns.

Stacked bar chart on public school enrollment changes.

Safety score heat map derived from clearance rate data.

Mood/tone visuals using color palettes of muted blues and grays to reflect decline and nostalgia.

These visualizations aim to immerse the reader in the story of declining towns, making data digestible and emotionally resonant.

# User research 

## Target audience
Residents of Pennsylvania (especially students and young professionals), state policymakers, and individuals interested in regional planning or demographic trends.

## Interview script

The purpose of my interview script is to determine whether audiences can understand the core issue behind Pennsylvania's shrinking population.

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
|To understand what does audience feels when looking at the visuals     |How do you feel when you see these data visuals?        |
|To see if there is any improvement for the story                       |What do you think to make the story better?             |
|To check if the audience gets the thing I want to present                   |What is the first information you get from the visuals? |
