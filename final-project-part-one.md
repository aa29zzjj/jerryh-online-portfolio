# Topic: The Shrinking Population of Pennsylvania


I have been in US for 6 years, and I have been in Pennsylvania for 5 years, which concludes my whole college & master life.
Although urban centers in Pennsylvania like Pittsburgh and Philadelphia continue to develop, many towns across the state are shrinking - in population, jobs, and services.
This makes me want to focus on this topic to see why there are more people is leaving from Pennsylvania to other states. Through a combination of data visualization and storytelling, I will present this project by relative data that will highlight:


1. What is the top 5 towns in Pennsylvania that are shrinking the fastest

2. What key factors (e.g. job loss, aging population, lack of amenities) correlate with decline

3. What life looks like in these “invisible cities” today

The purpose of this topic is to raise awareness about these communities often lost in big-picture state or national statistics. I would like to let the people who live in Pennsylvania to understand that: What is the key factor that makes shrinking population, and how can we attract more people to decide to stay in Pennsylvania.

## Initial sketches
1. Bar chart to every years' total population, every bar chart is combined to every town in Pennsylvania.
Example sketch is shown below (Made by [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)):

Note: this is the initial sketches. Not the actual sketch.

2. A line graph that shows the average annual salary in each Pennsylvania town.
Example sketch is shown below (Made by [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)):

# The data
I use these data source to:
1. Find out which are the top 5 shrinking town in PA
2. What is the main factor that cause the population shrinking in PA?
3. What can be the improvement for increasing PA's population?

Use the source from Pennsylvania State Data Center to find the shrinking city

# Method and medium
I will use use Shorthand for the storytelling platform, combined with: 
1. Tableau to initialize the table format
2. Using [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) to make the graphic design more specific.
3. upload to github profile

Finally, a polished Shorthand page with embedded, interactive charts and visual storytelling will be completed
