# Topic: The Shrinking Population of Pennsylvania


I have been in the US for 6 years, and I have been in Pennsylvania for 5 years, which concludes my whole college & master life.
Although urban centers in Pennsylvania like Pittsburgh and Philadelphia continue to develop, many towns across the state are shrinking - in population, jobs, and services.
This makes me want to focus on this topic to see why there are more people is leaving from Pennsylvania to other states. Through a combination of data visualization and storytelling, I will present this project by relative data that will highlight:


1. What are the top 5 counties in Pennsylvania that are shrinking the fastest

2. What key factors (e.g. job loss, aging population, lack of amenities) correlate with the decline

3. What life looks like in these “invisible cities” today

The purpose of this topic is to raise awareness about these communities often lost in big-picture state or national statistics. I would like to let the people who live in Pennsylvania to understand: What is the key factor that makes a shrinking population, and how can we attract more people to decide to stay in Pennsylvania?

# The data
I use these data sources to:
1. Find out which are the top 5 shrinking towns in PA
2. What is the main factor that causes the population to shrink in PA?
3. What can be the improvement for increasing PA's population?

# Method and medium
I will use Shorthand for the storytelling platform, combined with: 
1. Tableau/Flourish (generate map table if necessary) to initialize the table format
2. upload to Github profile

Finally, a polished Shorthand page with embedded, interactive charts and visual storytelling will be completed
