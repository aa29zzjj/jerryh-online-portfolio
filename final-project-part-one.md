# Topic: The Shrinking Population of Pennsylvania
> Include a high-level summary of your project.  This should be a couple paragraphs that describe what you're interested in showing with your final project.

I have been in US for 6 years, and I have been in Pennsylvania for 5 years, which concludes my whole college & master life.
Although urban centers in Pennsylvania like Pittsburgh and Philadelphia continue to develop, many towns across the state are shrinking - in population, jobs, and services.
This makes me want to focus on this topic to see why there are more people is leaving from Pennsylvania to other states. Through a combination of data visualization and storytelling, I will present this project by relative data that will highlight:


> A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story.  Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe what you hope to achieve.  Make sure the outline is detailed enough that we can see how you anticipate your story unfolding.  You can incorporate your Story Arc from the in-class exercise along with your user stories and one sentence summary to make the topic even more clear. 

1. What is the top 5 towns in Pennsylvania that are shrinking the fastest

2. What key factors (e.g. job loss, aging population, lack of amenities) correlate with decline

3. What life looks like in these “invisible cities” today

The purpose of this topic is to raise awareness about these communities often lost in big-picture state or national statistics. I would like to let the people who live in Pennsylvania to understand that: What is the key factor that makes shrinking population, and how can we attract more people to decide to stay in Pennsylvania.

## Initial sketches
1. Bar chart to every years' total population, every bar chart is combined to every town in Pennsylvania.
Example sketch is shown below (Made by [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)):
