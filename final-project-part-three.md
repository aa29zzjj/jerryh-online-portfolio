# Changes made since Part II

| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| The education rate visual may be misleading—it doesn’t include high school graduates. | Broaden the education rate definition to include high school graduates and adjust the visualization. |
| Some viewers found the line chart unclear or difficult to follow.    | Improve readability of the line chart by adding clear titles, labels, and perhaps switching to bar charts where helpful.    |
| The graph titles are too technical or long.  | Simplify and clarify all graph titles to be more viewer-friendly and aligned with the story. |
| Some charts were considered unnecessary or not aligned with the story.  | Review all visualizations and remove those not directly supporting the main narrative.    |
| Compare only shrinking counties might lack context. | 	Add a comparison to Top 5 increasing counties to provide more meaningful contrast in the story.     |
|Overall narrative felt broad—too many focuses. |	Refine story to focus on one or two key aspects, such as the relationship between salary and shrinkage.|
