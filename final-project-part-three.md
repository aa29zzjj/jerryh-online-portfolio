# The final data story
[What Makes Pennsylvania Shrinking?](https://preview.shorthand.com/3bqWJpiT35O44aoA)

# Changes made since Part II

After the interview for Part II, I received feedback from my teammates. The table shows the potential changes that I expect to do previously:

| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| The education rate visual may be misleading—it doesn’t include high school graduates. | Broaden the education rate definition to include high school graduates and adjust the visualization. |
| Some viewers found the line chart unclear or difficult to follow.    | Improve readability of the line chart by adding clear titles, labels, and perhaps switching to bar charts where helpful.    |
| The graph titles are too technical or long.  | Simplify and clarify all graph titles to be more viewer-friendly and aligned with the story. |
| Some charts were considered unnecessary or not aligned with the story.  | Review all visualizations and remove those not directly supporting the main narrative.    |
| Comparing only shrinking counties might lack context. | 	Add a comparison to Top 5 increasing counties to provide more meaningful contrast in the story.     |
|Overall narrative felt broad—too many focuses. |	Refine the story to focus on one or two key aspects, such as the relationship between salary and shrinkage.|

After reviewing feedback from Part II and analyzing audience interviews, several critical changes were made to improve clarity, focus, and narrative coherence:

1. **Improved Data Visualization's Readability**
Many viewers found the original line chart hard to interpret. I redesigned it using simplified labeling, bolded year markers, and more distinct color separation. In some cases, I replaced line charts with bar charts for a more digestible format.

2. **Simplified Graph Titles**
Technical or overly long chart titles were revised to be more accessible and story-aligned. For example, “2020–2023 Unemployment Rate for Top 5 Shrinking Counties” became “Jobless Trends in Pennsylvania’s Shrinking Counties.”

3. **Refined Focus: Shrinking vs. Growing Counties**
To provide context, I introduced a comparative element: the top 5 counties that are growing in population. This contrast enhances understanding of what factors contribute to growth vs. decline and helps anchor the shrinking counties within a broader state narrative.

4. **Removed Less-Relevant Visuals**
Based on audience feedback, it seems like non-relative data visualization, such as average salary for PA counties, is not valuable to the audience since it doesn't have any meaning for the stories. Besides, although education may be a factor that causes the population to shrink, it is not a good explanation since everyone has different thoughts on "educated". For example, are people who graduated from high school counted as educated? This will lead to another argument that who people are defined as educated people. Thus, these kinds of tables should be removed.


## The audience
The primary audience for this story includes:

**1. Pennsylvania residents, especially young adults, recent graduates, and local homeowners**

**2. Policy makers and urban planners concerned with demographic trends**

**3. Educators and researchers exploring the intersection of education, economy, and migration**

Audience interviews were crucial in shaping this project. For example, one viewer suggested incorporating the growing counties as a reference point, which led to a more balanced story. Another suggested simplifying the charts and ensuring that titles were easily digestible — changes that were fully incorporated.

These insights helped me focus not only on data accuracy but also on story accessibility, making sure people from all backgrounds can understand why this matters and what it means for their communities.

## Final design decisions
Throughout the project, I made several key design decisions that shaped the visual and narrative direction of the story:

**Chart Types:** Used a mix of bar charts on the offense count and the Top 5 population increase/decrease counties in PA.

**Color Palette:** For population increase/decrease in each PA county, opted for a consistent palette (green for stable/growing indicators, reds for decline) to maintain visual coherence and draw attention to shrinking metrics. For offense count, use blue gradient on Top 5 increasing PA counties and use orange gradient on Top 5 decreasing PA counties.

**Narrative Structure:** I changed my story to strictly focus on the relationship between population shrinking and safety. In the beginning, I use PA's population data visualization to point out that PA is shrinking in the year of 2023, then start looking at the Top 5 increasing/decreasing counties. Finally, show the comparison of offense count for these 2 types of counties to point out that safety is the core factor that causes people to leave the counties. By doing so, the  audience can easily follow the stories and directly get the purpose I want to present by these tables. 

**Medium:** Final storytelling was built in Shorthand to balance text, visual, and interactive storytelling. All graphs were created using Tableau Public.

**Accessibility:** Titles, captions, and axis labels were rewritten for clarity, and I have added the average line for the audience to see the big difference between these 2 types of PA counties.

# Final thoughts
This project was both personally meaningful and technically challenging. Having lived in Pennsylvania throughout my college and master’s journey, I’ve seen firsthand how some towns flourish while others quietly fade. I’m proud of how the final story evolved — from a broad, data-heavy exploration to a clearer, audience-driven narrative that balances empathy with analysis.

If I had more time, I would’ve liked to:

**1. Conduct interviews with residents in shrinking counties**

**2. Incorporate migration data from IRS or moving companies**

**3. Add a predictive model for future county-level changes**

Overall, I learned the importance of focus, audience empathy, and visual clarity. I hope this story not only informs but also sparks reflection among those who call Pennsylvania home.
