# jerryh-online-portfolio
These portfolio templates are for setting up your Telling Stories with Data site.  Edit these pages and add new ones as needed.   
It's always helpful to keep track of your web URL.  Consider putting that somewhere on your page for easy reference: 

- Web page URL: https://aa29zzjj.github.io/jerryh-online-portfolio/
- This repository: https://github.com/aa29zzjj/jerryh-online-portfolio/tree/main

# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  Here's where all my cool work will go.  You should probably hire me. 

# About me
Hi!  My name is Jerry Huang. I am in CMU MISM-16.
It is very interesting to study the course of Telling Story with Data since building up meaningful data graphics is very important for viewers.
It may be helpful to my future career goal. I would like to be project/product manager in the future.
Fun things: Red Hot Chili Pepper is my favorite band

# What I hope to learn

1. How to correctly do data observation
2. Learn how to effectively create meaningful, clear, understandable graphics for viewers.
3. Understand different purpose from each graphic.

## Assignment:
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `visualizing-government-debt.md`.  For links to Markdown files in your repository, you can just include the name of the page without the `.md` extension. 

### Telling Story with Data - Assignment 1 - Working with Tableau: Visualizing Government Debt: 
#### Part 2: Working with Tableau

### Telling Story with Data -  Assignment: Critique and redesign
## Step 3: 2025 Steam Top 100 Played Games by Type
Thought:
To deal with the data of Steam Top 100 games, I divided the games into three categories:

1. Team-based: Required more than 2 players (for each team) to play. Competing with other team.
2. PVP: person versus person 
3. Co-op: No competition, cooperating with each player.
4. Single player: only 1 person can play the game.

Then, I calculate each category's current players to see what is the most popular category in Steam. 
By doing so, viewers can check what type of game is the most popular on Steam to check what kind of customers are attracted by Steam's games.
Otherwise, I will point out the top 3 games in each category, so it is also a good recommendation graphic for players.

## Other stuff you can do (you can remove this section - it's just for your reference.)

### Changing text

You can change text, like this: 

**Here's some bold** text.  Here's some *italic* text. Here's some ~~strikethrough~~ text. 

### Creating tables

You can build tables like this: 

| Name         | Type of pet | Favority activity 1 | FA 2   | FA 3            | FA 4                                |
|--------------|-------------|---------------------|--------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|
| Eli          | cat         | Sleeping            | Eating | Being pet       | Plotting to overthow dog empire     |
| Howard       | dog         | You                 | You    | You             | Eating                              |
| Frankenstein | fish        | Swimming            | Eating | Blowing bubbles | Forgetting                          |

An easy-to-use template generator tool [can be found here](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables)

You can use different headings, like this: 

# Here's a large title (H1)
## Here's a subtitle (H2)
### ...and so on (H3)
You get the idea - just don't forget the space between the # and your title.  `#Title` won't work, but `# Title` will. 

### Adding images

Here's an example of how to add an image to my portfolio.  

![funny dog picture](funny-dog-unsplash.jpg)
> Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/pt-br/@charlesdeluvio?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText">charlesdeluvio</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/K4mSJ7kc0As?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a>
  

Alternately, you can set the size of the image using just a bit of HTML: 

<img src="funny-dog-unsplash.jpg" width="200"/>

Remember that you'll need to upload the image into your repository, or include a link to the image somewhere else.  

### Setting up a separate page

So here's the code you'll need to add to your own site to create a second page. 

1. First, create a new page in your repository (for example, dataviz1.md)
2. Next, add a link to that page by inserting the following into your readme.md page:

`[title](dataviz)` or `[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` or `[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)`

Any of those formats will work. Here's some examples of working links: 

`[title](dataviz)` = [title](dataviz)  
`[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` = [dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)  
`[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)` = [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)   

Make sure to check these from your publicly accessible URL to make sure they're working correctly (not from the preview tab).
